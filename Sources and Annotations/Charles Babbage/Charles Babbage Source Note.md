### Summary & Key Takeaways

- Charles Babbage was known by many as the "Father of computing", as he created many computational devices. He was a mathematician and worked on researching many difficult math equations in the 1820s. This led him to create a device that could do these computations and print them out. He designed a couple of devices to do this, such as the Analytical Machine and the Difference Engine No2. He dedicated his life to creating this machine but did not live to see them built as the government stopped funding him.
