> - **Abstract:** Cryptology is the science of secret writing. It is made up of two halves; cryptography consists of the techniques for creating systems of secret writing and cryptanalysis encompasses the techniques of breaking them. Over the past 2500 years, cryptology has developed numerous types of systems to hide messages and subsequently a rich vocabulary in which to describe them. In this chapter we introduce the reader to the vocabulary of cryptology, explain the differences between codes and ciphers and begin the discussion of how to decipher an unknown message.

### Ideas/Thoughts

> [!quote|#2ea8e5] Highlight
> human needs and desires that demand privacy among two or more people in the midst of social life must inevitably lead to cryptology wherever men thrive and wherever they write.
>
>> As soon as humans evloved in literature, cryptology was born. People wanted privacy and so they took to writing secret messages.

> [!quote|#2ea8e5] Highlight
> Governments, the military, and people in business have desired to keep their communications secret ever since the invention of writing. Spies, lovers, and diplomats all have secrets and are desperate to keep them as such.
>
>> This can still be seen in todays culture with encryption in coding, passwords and secret words.

> Secret ink, microdots, and using different fonts on printed pages are all ways of hiding the message from prying eyes
>
>> Secret messages had to be secret from another persons eyes, many factors had to be taken into consideration as stated by Dooley.

> Cryptology, on the other hand, makes absolutely no effort to hide the presence of the secret message. Instead it transforms the message into something unintelligible so that if the enemy intercepts the message they will have no hope of reading it.
>
>> Cryptology is not just hiding the message, rather it is the idea that the message can be seen easily but cannot be understood and needed to be decrypted.

> One could argue that a code is also a substitution cipher, just one with a larger number of substitutions.
>
>> It is important to understand that a code is different than a cipher.

> But some codes are used merely for efficiency.
>
>> The discovery of encoding allows us to simplify other task. This can be related to texting nowadays where many words or phrases are shortened or encoded to allow for faster texting.

> The codebook must also be kept physically secure, ideally locked up when not in use.
>
>> This is the target for many spies throughout history. Because the codebook holds all the information needed to decode a message, if the opposition was to get their hands on it, they could easily get advantage over their opponent.

> Management of the keys is a problem because a secure method must be used to transmit the keys to all users.

>> If the key is unable to be transferred to a user they will be unable to decipher the message.
