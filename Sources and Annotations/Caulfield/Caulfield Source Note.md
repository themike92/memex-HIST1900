### Summary & Key Takeaways

- In Caulfield's 'The Garden and the Stream: A Technopastoral', he takes a look at a way of organizing information like a wiki and relates it to a garden. Caulfield explains that the garden is a representation of information we have collected, and by learning and expanding our own personal wiki, we are watering our garden. When we organize our notes in the form of a wiki, new ideas and viewpoints emerge, as per Caulfield. He explains how our garden is like our own personal web, "The Garden is the web as topology. The web as space. Itâ€™s the integrative web, the iterative web, the web as an arrangement and rearrangement of things to one another." (Caulfield 1). The garden is our own complex web, which we up-keep by adding and expanding on. When we take a walk down our garden, we see all our ideas and experiences are generated as per Caulfield. He also explored the concept of the stream, which he described as "the Stream presents us with a single, time ordered path with our experience (and only our experience) at the centre" (Caulfield). The stream is a curated set of ideas and viewpoints that are created during our experiences (web exploring). Caulfield explains that in order to understand where someone is coming from, we need to go down their stream and see all the viewpoints and ideas they have come across.
