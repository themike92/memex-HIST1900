### Canary Islands dispute:

- Page 109: There was much interest in the control of northwestern Africa. Many powerful countries wanted to build their telegraph lines in the area, so a competition for it was created.


- Page 110: Among the countries competing were Britain, France and Germany. Countries like Morocco and the Canaries was of top priority for these counties, and it created a pressure between them to have a telegraph line there would be beneficial. The main feud was between Franco-British and Germans.


- Page 111: A war between the USA and Spain began, and that sparked the need for countries to own the lines that connected its territories. Another stress created was the control over communication.


- Page 113-114: Germany wanted to connect their lines to Atlantic Africa. They had lines connecting to Asia and had lines connection to American lines, so the next step was for them to connect with South America and western Africa. It was a battle of territory between English operated lines and German lines. Germany had to find a way to pass the line through British occupied areas. The only option the Germans had was to use the Canary Islands to connect their lines.


- Page 115: German begins talks with Spain about passing a line through Emden and Canaries. The Franco-British were not happy about this. Germany's decision to connect its colonies with its own telegraph line revolutionized the communications perspective and boasted great opportunity for the country.


- Page 116: Britain and France saw the advantages of this deal and wrote to the Spanish government to think about the deal. In response the Spanish government halted their decision.
