- *Complex* → system that has components that don't depend on each other (i.e. road traffic)
- *Complicated* → needs all pieces to do their part (i.e. space shuttle)
- Assemblage Theory: amercement; things come together. 
- Meaning depends on context; both internal, external in time, external in space, nothing is meaningful on its own
- **Perspectivism:** the way we record information matters
- We mirror ‘Natural Breakages’, many ways to make the decisions
- These categories emerge from our engagement with the material
- A network is a present when there is a relationship between two entities in which info flows 
- Networks form a substrate for social life
- networks leave physical traces
- Networks provide a formal mechanism where computation can happen
- Meaning is relational
- network is more than just communication, it connects things together through many different ways
