### Analytical Machines:
-   The Turing machine, can read, write, scan and remember binary numbers on a tape
-   uses the machine to test if there are any conditions where it can predict if it will fail and if there are any conditions where it can predict whether a symbol till be predicted
-   There wasn't much of a social necessity for these machines
-   The rise of new computational devices began, and many prototypes were created
-   Kelvin created a tide calculator and ways to explore complex equations
-   IBM counters and tabulators were able to do addition, subtraction and multiplication
-   George Stibitz creates the model one and performs a demo where he performs remote calculations in 1940.
-   These types of devices are getting similar to the early computers.
-   These devices were complex calculators and were used for war. The lack of info and speed at which the info was created during the war created the push for computers
-   Electronic numerical integrator and calculator/computer, developed by Mauchly and Eckert
-   Women were the ones that coded the machine
-   Grace Hopper was a key component in the history of the computer
