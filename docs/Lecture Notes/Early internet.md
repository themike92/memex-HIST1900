### The foundation of the early internet:
-   What we needed:
	-   Existence of digital computers
	-   Existence of telecommunication networks 
	-   Existence of information theory
	-   Ideas around flow control, logic, algorithms
-   Time sharing
	-   Technique for using the speed of the computer to present the appearance of multiple simultaneous users
	-   Terminal - keyboard/ whatever is transmitting instructors displaying results
-   needs to be a way to connect the terminal to the machine
-   Modem allows us to do that. Modulates digital pulses into sounds, demodulates sound into digital data
-   Rand corporation, like a think tank
-   Barans system is not hierarchical, switches can reroute as necessary
-   Barans packet switching

-   People didn't want people using their computers, but IMPs makes it seem ok
-   These IMPs are like rounders nowadays
