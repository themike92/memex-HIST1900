### How the Gutta-percha tree was effected by the telegraph
-  As the popularity of the telegraph grew, it was evident that it would have to travel long distances underwater to reach different areas around the world. The way the telegraph worked it needed a good insulator in order to keep the signal strong
- At the time a type of plastic/rubber was used, but it did not survive underwater for very long and people needed a new material that would be good for this task.
- People turned to gutta-percha gum, which happened to be the perfect element they were looking for. So it was mass-produced and the amount of gutta-percha tress dwindled. 
- Before the governments could stop it, mostly all the gutta-percha supply was gone and the demand for it was ever-increasing.
