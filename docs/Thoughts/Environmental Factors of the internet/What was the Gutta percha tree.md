### Gutta-Percha:
-   The Gutta Percha tree is native to Southeast Asia and was highly valued for its gum, called "gutta-percha." 
- This latex was used in the 19th century for a wide range of industrial applications, including insulation for underwater telegraph cables, electrical wiring, canes, shoe soles, knife handles, and even dental fillings. 
- The material was prized for its toughness, resistance to water and chemicals, and ability to be moulded into various shapes. 
- There was not an infinite amount of gutta-percha available, and it had a hard time keeping up with the demand for it.
- This made it the perfect contestant for lining the cables around the globe.
