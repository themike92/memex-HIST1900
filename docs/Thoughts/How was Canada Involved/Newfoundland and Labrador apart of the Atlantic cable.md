### Newfoundland and Labrador's contribution to the research of submarine cables:

-  Newfoundland and Labrador played a significant role in the research and development of the Transatlantic Cable. Cyrus Field sought to connect North America and Europe with a telegraph cable that could transmit messages across the ocean. 
- Field chose Newfoundland as the location for the eastern terminal of the cable due to its proximity to Europe and the presence of a suitable harbour. This was a benefit for Canada, as it meant that the cable connecting the two continents was located in Canada and could have Canadian influence.
- The region played an essential role in testing and laying the cable. The first transatlantic cable was tested in Newfoundland's Placentia Bay. The cable was too weak and broke during the trial. Having a testing center in Canada meant that Canadians were front and center for the creation of international communication. 
- A successful cable was laid connecting Heart's Content to Valentia Island in Ireland. The Transatlantic Cable had a massive impact on communication between North America and Europe, and Newfoundland and Labrador's contribution to this milestone of technological achievement is widely recognized.
