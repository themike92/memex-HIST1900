### What is Word/Letter Frequency?

- Dooley briefly describes what he calls "word frequencies" (Dooley 11). The English language has a limited number of letters, and many of which are commonly used in all texts. Letter and word frequency was an easy way to decipher hidden messages.
- Certain letters appear more than others such as the letter 'e' which cryptanalyst can use to their advantage when decrypting secret messages.
