### What is a code?

- A code is different from a cipher in many ways. A code will have a phrase or number that represents a keyword entirely, rather than a substitution of letters.
- Dooley defines a code as, "A code uses variable sized elements that have meaning in the plaintext language" (Dooley 5).
- A code is much more difficult to decode than a cipher for the fact that the phrase or number representing the keyword has no relation to the keyword in any way. Dooley explains how a code works, "A code always takes the form of a book where a numerical or alphabetic codeword is substituted for a complete word or phrase from the plaintext." (Dooley 6). A word will be represented by a number or letter.
- A way to complicate a code more is to create a grid of numbers and give the code breaker directions such as up, down, left or right. Some numbers in this grid can be null as well, meaning they do not actually represent any keyword.
