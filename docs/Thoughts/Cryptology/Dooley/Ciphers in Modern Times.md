### Ciphers in Technology:

- In modern days, it is extremely important to encrypt data and have tough to crack passcodes. There are many people that are constantly trying to hack or decrypt huge systems of information.
- Companies have a secret way to encrypt their data, similar to a code or cipher. They have to make it extremely complex in order for it not to be broken.
- Dooley explains the power in getting a hand on a key for a cipher, "Security of the key is of paramount importance for cipher systems." (Dooley 9). If a key is compromised, any hidden data can be revealed and exploited.
- Millions of dollars are spent on programs to encrypt important data, and when these systems are broken into it is called a security breach.
