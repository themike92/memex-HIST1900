### What was it:
- The enigma machine was a device designed in the 1920s that encrypted messages as per author Smart of the Cryptography Made Simple textbook.
- It had a plug board where each plug connected one letter on the keyboard to another. This key was given to the user, and it changed each day in order to stop anyone from cracking the code. Once the plug board was correctly inputted all it required was the user to type their message normally, and it would add the shift of characters automatically to a piece of paper
- Because a machine was used, it allowed for efficient ciphers and messages were easily encrypted and sent out.
