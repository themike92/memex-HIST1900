### What was the Caesar Cipher?

- It was a simple encoding practice that shifted the alphabet by a numerical amount, and each letter would be represented by another.
- Julius Caesar needed a way to convey messages to his armies and not have the risk of the enemy discovering his plans, so he created the Caesar shift.
- At the time it was created it did not require any resources that were hard to get, rather all one needed was a paper and a key which held the shift number.
- Because it is simple, it can be decoded very quickly, meaning it is not very reliable. Many modern ciphers improved on the Caesar cipher, and it is the backbone to many ciphers.
