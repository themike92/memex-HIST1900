### Society is affected by media:

- The way a message is classified has implications of power, control and discipline. Messages contain knowledge, and knowledge is power. People all throughout history are constantly trying to steal, intercept or understand the messages of others because of the idea that media contains knowledge
- Gitelman explains how media is created through society "Media are more properly the results of social and economic forces, so that any technological logic they possess is only apparently intrinsic" (Gitelman 10). Media naturally develops inside society and circulates throughout it. It is seen as crucial to society.
- Media holds knowledge in many different forms, and having access to a piece of media can give someone a greater power of knowledge compared to people around them. A good book can teach a person something that changes their lives, which is an example of why media is important to have. From this fact, people would store their collected media in what we now call libraries.
