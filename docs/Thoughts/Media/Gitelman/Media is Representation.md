### Representation as media:
- Humans need ways to represent themselves whether it be through music, stories, tales, ideas, etc. representation is the key to humanity. 
- Media is representation. Humans represent themselves through media. Culture is a big part of what makes up a human, being able to express this culture is a part of our nature and we do this through media
- Gitelman explains how media illustrates culture, "Media are so integral to a sense of what representation itself is" (Gitelman 4). Media is used to represent culture, stories, knowledge, ideas, memories, messages, and many more important things to humans. Having a way to represent ourselves and pass it along to others is vital for humans.
