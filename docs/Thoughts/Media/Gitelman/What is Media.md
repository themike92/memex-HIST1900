### How media is Referred to:

- Nowadays, the word media is used to represent a unified entity. The true meaning of media is plural, and it is used very vaguely. Media allows humans to communicate and express feelings to one another. As we evolved, the need for a way to preserve messages or knowledge became increasing more important, allowing the opportunity for media to be born ^455caa
- Media is anything that conveys a message in any way shape or form, but media is not the physical way the message is conveyed rather it is the message itself. Media is the message that is coveyed through [[Mediums]]. ^245b56
