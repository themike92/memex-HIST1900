### History is found through media:

- Media is one of the key pillars in the history of not only the internet but the history of everything, as it is the key piece in understanding what was going on during past times. A quote by Gitelman explains this perfectly, "But media are also historical because they are functionally integral to a sense of pastness" (Gitelman 5).
- Because media is a representation of human culture, when media from the past is discovered, it allows us to get an insight into the culture of the time and understand what the societal normalities were.
