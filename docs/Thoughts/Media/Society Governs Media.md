### How does Society Govern Media:
- It is not common to question whether media has underlying rules or not, but if you take a deeper dive into media and reflect on the dos and don'ts, you will see that media follows a strict set of rules governed by social and economic beliefs.
- It is seen as wrong to post something that goes against societal views, and people treat it with the same demeanor they see as a crime. 
- This is easily seen with mass media apps such as TikTok or Instagram. If a 'post' were to go against society views, the creator will get hammered with hate, even though the post may seem harmless at first.
