### How is Technology Growing:

- In modern times, technology has a great amount of computation speed and allows many professions to use this power to make new discoveries. As technology grows, it is becoming more complex, but it is more reliable as well as more readily available to people. 
- Author Bush states, "The world has arrived at an age of cheap complex devices of great reliability" (Bush 1). Although there are new technologies that preform tasks much faster, some processes are still the same, such as developing a picture. Bush explains, "It would be a brave man who would predict that such a process will always remain clumsy, slow, and faulty in detail."(Bush 1). The way a TV works is a very similar process to how they worked in the past, showing that over time, although the process has become faster, there has been no major improvement on the process itself.
