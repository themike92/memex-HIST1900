### How all the world's information will fit in the palm of your hand:

- Author Bush describes the idea of a microfilm that will cost very cheap and will be able to store massive amounts of information in the area of a desk. Bush makes a bold prediction, "They will be controlled by a control card or film, they will select their own data and manipulate it in accordance with the instructions thus inserted, they will perform complex arithmetical computations at exceedingly high speeds, and they will record results in such form as to be readily available for distribution or for later further manipulation" (Bush 2). What he is describing is eerily similar to phones nowadays.
- Relating this to modern times, Bush's idea came to life in the form of phones. With programs like google, all the world's information can be found on the web, similar to the microfilm bush described.
