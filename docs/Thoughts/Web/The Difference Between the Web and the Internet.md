- The author talks about how the overlap between the internet and the web are rooted in social imaginary and people tend to mix up the 2.

### The Web and the Internet are two distinct things:
- The Majority of people nowadays don't give a thought to the fact that the web is completely different from the internet, and the terms have become synonymous with each other.
- We have to remember that the web is a link between different hypertext areas, it is a place that sorts each user into where they want to be.
- The internet on the other hand is what we use to not only access the web but communicate and so much more. It is the thing the web is built on.
- The internet can be seen as computers communicating with each other back and forth using nodes and packet switching, whereas the web is something the user uses to go to different areas among the internet.
