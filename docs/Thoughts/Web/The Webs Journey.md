### 2.1.1 The Webs Journey:

-  Bory briefly talks about how society expects a linear story similar to that of a hero, and outlines Berners-Lee's story. 
- It starts with the departure, this is where the hero is called to go on his quest. This is then related to Berners' childhood where he was surrounded by new technologies which gave him his start towards the web. 
- The next stage is the initiation, this is where the hero works towards his quest. For Berners, it is when he begins to spread his idea around and gets input from others and begins the initial stages of the web's creation. 
- The return stage is where the hero comes back to his world and changes it and solidifies his name. For Berners this means making the final touches on the web and protecting his invention from big companies, releasing the web and being credited for the huge societal change.
- In the end, for Berners we all get to use the web that he created and at the end of the day he gets little to no credit or praise from society for his revolutionary invention.
