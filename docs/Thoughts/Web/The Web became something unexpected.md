- Initially, the web was advertised as a tool to retrieve information rather than a complete cultural shift.

### The impact of the web:
- The web was designed and brought into society as a way for people to retrieve information from the internet at the time. It was not predicted to have the societal shift that it does nowadays and really exceeded expectations
- In today's world, we really on the web for a multitude of reasons. We use it for researching, shopping, connecting, and so much more. It is something that we all rely on all the time, and for many people we can't imagine a world without it.
