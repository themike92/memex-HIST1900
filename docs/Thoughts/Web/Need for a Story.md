The creation of the web can be in some way sculpted by a narrative and internalized the life of its inventor. It can be put into this framework that most invention stories follow. The author talks about the imaginary and how it acts as a process of sense making. What I believe the author is saying is that the way people picture the story of how the internet was created is a narrative that is imaginary and is not true, yet it has shaped the internet into what it is today.

### Why did society need a story for the web:
- The true story of the web is messy, complicated and contains many different people and components. People find this hard to understand, so a simple, easy to follow story was created.
- The problem with this is that it leaves out key people, ideas, and components that were greatly influential to the web's creation. An example of this is Ted Nelson's hypertext, which I think the author, Bory, touches on perfectly.
- Because the web was such a new piece of technology, its creation story is seen by many as imaginary, or a figment of our imagination as the author describes. It was hard for people to believe that this is how a revolutionary piece of technology was put together.
