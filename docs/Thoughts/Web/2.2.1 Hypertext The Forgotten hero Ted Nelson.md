- Page 54: Hypertext is a key component of the web. The web was not like any other previous program, it had a revolutionary way of hyperlinking, hypermedia. Hypertext was the ideal solution to both Berners and Nelsons problems. It could tackle the problem of information loss and a way to re-organize document retrieval practices.
- Page 55: In Nelson's paper, he connected past media imaginaries to hypertext.
- Page 56: There was a social need to turn new machines into information organization, which hypertext was able to do, and that is what brought it into society.
