### What the Web is able to do:
- The web has become revolutionary in the technology word, as it has completely changed how things are connected.
- After the introduction of hypertext, the ability to create links between computers and programs was created. The web is able to hold all of these links together and connect to each and every link.
- The irony of googles name history is that is based on the fact that it was able to reach out to a Google (number) of different resources.
- Due to this, the web became the thing that guides us through the internet and allows us to get from point A to point B online without the need to type in full directories in our command prompts.
