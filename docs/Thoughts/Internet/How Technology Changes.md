- The author brings up a good idea, if we were to bring back the inventors of the car or the telephone they would be surprised to see that the physical components or the initial intent of its use has not changed. They will also be surprised to see that there has been a great change in the way people use it.

### Technology Over time:

- When we take this idea and look at the internet and communication in general, it is crazy to think about how much it has improved even in a time span of 20 years.
- Relating this to CPUs in computers, the CPUs nowadays outmatch the CPUs even just 10 years ago by massive amounts.
- If we were to bring someone from the early 2000s to today and showed them the internet, it would be like they were living in a dystopian world.
- The transition technology has taken has been influenced by our ever rapid-moving world, and it can be seen in the advancements we have made.
