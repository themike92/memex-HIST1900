### Cool analogies:

- Because the new BBSs brought people who may have never met to a close relationship, I think what the author is saying and the way phrases the way of how computers are directly affected people is quite cool.

> It was the intimacy of direct, computer-to-computer connection that did it.[^1]

- Being a part of a BBS means you would come into direct contact with the owner and get to speak to them remotely. You get to see what they are proud of and what they are a fan of.

> To call a BBS was to visit the private residence of a fellow computer fan electronically.[^1]

- This encapsulates how niche bulletin boards were. I think the analogy is perfect, as the island represents the small community of people communicating, and the bottle is the messages left by others. 

> BBSes are like remote Pacific islands, each populated with pocket civilizations that communicate reluctantly via message-in-a-bottle.[^1]
