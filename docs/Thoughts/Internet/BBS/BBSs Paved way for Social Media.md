It was a way for a community of people who shared interest to connect with one another.

### Early Social Media:
- These BBSs were communities of people sharing niche messages to one another, similar to this, we can see places like Reddit or discord have the same concept.
- It was the first time people communicated online and rules had not yet been created such as trolling. This is still seen in today's world with people who act in harmful ways online.
- It paved the way for social media, as it allowed us to see for the first time how groups of people would communicate with each other without the face to face aspect.
