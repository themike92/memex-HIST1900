### What was the BBSs:
- It was a system that allowed people to send messages to each other using their personal computers. Someone with a personal computer and a modem would have to dial-in to the bulletin board before they could read and leave messages
- It acted similar to a real life bulletin board where people had the choice to just visit and browse or share their ideas, get news alerts and know when events would be happening.
- As bulletin boards grew, many new niche boards were created, and it began to form online communities across America. They were initially created to avoid having to meet in person with a group to share ideas, and they ended up growing to something much bigger.
