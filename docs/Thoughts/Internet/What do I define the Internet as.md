### The Internet:
- The internet is not us typing something on Google and getting a result or scrolling on social media. The internet is the way in which our computers communicate with each other.
- The internet is something we use every day and don't think twice about what the internet actually is. 
- The internet to me can be seen as a network of computers or servers, and it does all the talking. So when we turn on our device and go on something like discord, the internet would be sending a message to one of discords servers, which would then communicate back with our device. This is what the internet is, it is the paths and messages that get sent, the ones that we can't see. ^3fda2c
