### Security and Trust Issues:

- In Denning's book, he talks about the problems that may arise within the internet, security and trust. As computer networks grew and gained more active users, people began to create malware and other means of stealing information from other peoples computers. ^1983ba
- This can still be seen nowadays as people, companies and the government are constantly making sure their information is secure from others. Also in current day internet users information are being bought and sold by companies which poses a threat to the security of a person's information on the web.
- The other conflict Denning talk about was trust. In the early internet, people trusted the companies that they would buy from and uses services from. They trusted that these companies would not abuse their power.
- Nowadays, trust is a major problem on the internet. Not only can companies not be trusted, people can't be trusted as well. Also, information on the internet cannot be trusted as it may not be factual. A more recent problem with trust is trusting whether people on the internet are real humans or not.
