### AI is Scary:
- AI has been ramping up in today's society at a scary rate. Over the first quarter of 2023 we have seen a massive breadth of AIs take over the internet
- This is not a good thing as many of these AIs have not been regulated and not many security and trust laws have been created to protect us from them.
- They tend to look around the internet taking the most popular opinions and point of views when giving us information, and it is impossible to know whether they got their information from a valid source.
- As of now, we cannot trust what information we read on the internet, as we don't know if it was made by a human or an AI.
