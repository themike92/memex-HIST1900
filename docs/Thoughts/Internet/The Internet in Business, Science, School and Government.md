### How the internet affected science, school, business, and government:

-   The author predicts 4 different discourses; scientific technology, business, higher education and government. I find it cool that they are trying to predict or find ways to prepare the networks for the future without knowing what the future of the networks is.
-   "It views situations, including those that involve the human condition, as "problems" for which technological and procedural "solutions" are to be found", I find this quote can be related to today as we go to technology to solve many of our problems. (Driscoll)
	- Relating this to Eric's Memex in the note about 'Computers support Humans'(see below), He describes how the main vision behind computers is to benefit humans and make things easier for us. This relates to the quote outlined above, as we would use technology to solve our problems for us.
-   The author talks about how business was affected by technology. This can be related to today, as nowadays almost all business is has a digital component.
-   The author talks about education and technology. The current day implications of this were prevalent during COVID, and a lot of education nowadays has been fully moved online.
-   "The significance of the ARPANET and its derivatives lies not in the networking technology, but in the fundamental shifts in human practices that have resulted"(Denning 533).
