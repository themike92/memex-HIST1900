- "the Act has been highly controversial due in part to its vagueness; it is not clear what exactly constitutes “obscene” or “sexually explicit material.”"
	- Is this the true reason why the act is controversial? When an AI looks around the web, it tends to take the top results, meaning many of its results are based on popularity rather than truth. Although in this case its point may be partially true, we can never be sure if it is the full facts. My argument behind this is that yes it may be controversial due to its vagueness, but I think the more dominant reason is because it violates human rights and freedoms even if its initial intent was to help protect people.

- "That Section 230 was constitutional and did not violate First Amendment rights as it only restricted access to certain materials deemed obscene by Congress or state legislatures"
	- Completely disregards its previous point, as it was talking about vagueness, then about the first amendment rights.

- "The CDA has been amended several times since its inception, most recently with the passage of The Protect Act (PROTECT) which further clarified what material is considered “obscene” and made sure that Section 230 was not being abused to access such materials by minors."
	- From the outside, this information seems extremely factual, but it is hard to know where the source is.

### Final Thoughts:

- Although AI may be an interesting tool and fun to play around with, when it comes to getting important information from it and trusting that its information came from a viable source we have to take heavy precautions as a lot of information online especially popular opinions which may or not be true are pushed to the top and used by the AI.
