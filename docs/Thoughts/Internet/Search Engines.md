### What do they do and How much do they help us:
- Search engines allow us to quickly find the information we need by using an algorithm that gives us the best result. Without search engines, finding information on the web would be extremely hard as there are billions upon billions of results for topics
- A search engine is a software that has a text field, and a display format for when a search is completed.
- A search engine usually works in a set way. They tend to use what's called a spider or crawler that goes through results and finds keywords and backlinks that relate to the topic, and they also have a database of results related to topics. The efficiency of the engine all depends on the algorithm and the way they rank pages.
- Most tend to rank pages based on the amount of keywords they have that link to the search. Others such as Google take into account backlinks, keywords and popularity, creating a page rank system.
- Some top search engines are; Google, Yahoo, Firefox, Opera, Internet Explorer and Bing.
