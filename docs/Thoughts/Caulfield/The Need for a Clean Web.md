### The Garden is a clean Web:

- Caulfield's idea of a personal garden that represents our own personal web is to combat the fact the is filled with false and corrupted information.
- If we create a complex, true garden of information, will be able to learn better from it and, and can influence others. We will be able to see all the viewpoints to ideas when we have unbiased notes.
- Caulfield brings an amazing point, "we can imagine a world, I think, so much better than this one, if only we can get our heads out of the Stream for a bit, and build the Garden we need." If we build a garden full of what we need, we will be better off.
