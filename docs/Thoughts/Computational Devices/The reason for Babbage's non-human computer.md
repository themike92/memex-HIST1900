### Non-Human Computers:
- Charles Babbage worked on many creations that would allow a machine to do his calculations and print them out. These machines included the analytical engine and the difference engine.
- He created them to automate and simplify mathematical calculations as he was frustrated by the slow pace of human calculation
- This can be related to today's world as nowadays we are always using technology to make our lives easier and more simple. We can all relate to Charles as we all like how technology can for example make calling a friend really simple compared to how it was 50â€“60 years ago.
