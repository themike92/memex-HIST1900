### Who was Grace Hopper:
- Grace Hopper was one of the most influential people in the history of not only computers but the internet.
- She was a mathematics professor and worked with the new device called the mark 1 invented by Aiken. She was tasked with coming up with the code for the machine to produce a result to a complex equation, and had just two weeks to do so. Not only that, but she was given no manual and had to learn how to operate the machine from the ground up
- She managed to complete the task, and it was extraordinary how the machine worked, but she was given no praise and was not invited to any of the awards ceremonies or parties.
- She continued to work on machines such as these and formed a group of women who would hand code these machines.
