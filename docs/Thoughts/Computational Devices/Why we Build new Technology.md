### How new Technology helps us:
- We, as humans, create new technologies to improve our lives, solve problems, and satisfy our curiosity. We use technology to make tasks easier, faster, and more efficient, to explore and discover new things, and to enhance our experiences. 
- We also use technology to meet societal needs, such as communication, transportation, and energy production. As technology continues to advance, we will likely continue to create new and innovative solutions to the challenges we face.
