### Countries competing for connection:

-  As countries began to see the benefits of the telegraph, they tried to get their lines to as many of their colonies as possible. This posed a big benefit if they were able to accomplish this
- At the time the main two countries competing were Germany and Britain. Germany stirred up problems when they tried to make a deal with the Spanish government to lay their able there. Britain was opposed to this and asked Spanish governments to wait on their decision.
- Germany resorted to using the Canary Islands as a place to lay cable, even though it would require much more cable. The benefits were much bigger than the cost, and the cable was laid.
