### The Telegraph allowed for Long Distance Communication:
- The telegraph allowed communication to be had across extreme distances as long as a wire was connecting each side. This was revolutionary for the time, as communication of long distances was limited. It was used to connect railways together and coordinate trips, decreasing time travelled.
- Past civilizations had methods of communication such as smoke, drums or structures. These were all prone to weather and were limited in what could be conversed. The telegraph allowed for detailed messages to be shared instantly between two points.
- A wire laid at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean opened a whole new world of opportunity, as cross-continental communication was possible.
