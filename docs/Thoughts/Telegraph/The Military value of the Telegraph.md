### The Telegraph's role in Military:
- Due to the speed at which a message can be sent over a great distance by the telegraph, it provided an immense benefit to countries using it.
- It was much easier to move troops around and control where the army was, as they could receive messages from a far distance.
- The ability to communicate quickly and reliably meant that different military units could coordinate their efforts more effectively. It was effective when multiple groups of troops were needed.
- Military leaders could gather intelligence from remote areas more easily. They could receive reports from scouts and spies and send instructions back to them. This improves situational awareness and the ability to respond to changing conditions.
- The telegraph provided a secure means of communication that was much harder to intercept or disrupt. This made it more difficult for enemy forces to intercept messages and gain an advantage.
