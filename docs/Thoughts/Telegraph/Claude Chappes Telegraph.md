### The First Telegraph

- Claude Chappe's telegraph was an early communication system that used a series of mechanical arms to transmit messages over long distances. It was deemed the first telegraph and became popular in Europe in the 18th century.
- The telegraph consisted of a series of towers with mechanical arms that could be positioned to form letters and numbers. The telegraph towers that were built were spread along so that they could each see one tower.
- From Eric's memex, "When it intrigued Charles-Gilbert Romme, the current president of the Committee of Public Instruction, it led to the French government becoming interested in the technology." This led to the wide spread of these telegraphs across France and Europe.
- These towers were very helpful during the French Revolution, as they allowed the people to communicate across the country in a quick manner.
- These towers however were flawed. They relied on the terrain of the area meaning flat land, no mountains etc.  and these towers could only be used during the day, because at night the messages could not be seen. These towers also did not preform well in foggy areas.
- Although nowadays, this technology is no longer used, Chappe's telegraph played an important role in the development of modern communication systems.
