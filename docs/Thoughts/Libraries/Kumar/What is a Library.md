### Libraries:
- A Library allows us to store a vast amounts of media in one place. "The library catalogue is a list and an index to its collection of books and other materials" (Kumar 1). Having libraries allows us to search for documents and look for information in an organized fashion.
- There was no normal way to store information, before the current organization standards, information was mainly lying around or owned by certain people rather than a specific place in time.
- Kumar described two main concepts a library uses to store information, "The two main tools are classification and catalogue. Classification helps in arranging documents on shelves in a systematic order; the catalogue helps in organizing, identifying, and locating the required documents" (Kumar 1). Having these ways to store knowledge allowed for easier ways to access it.
