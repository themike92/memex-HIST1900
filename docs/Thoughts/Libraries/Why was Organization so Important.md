### Why was it crucial to store information:
- Over the course of history many different people have contributed to many different fields such as science, technology, psychology etc. and the amount of literature and authors was rapidly growing. Storing this information allowed future scientists, psychologist, etc. to expand on previous work, reference previous work or counter previous work.
- Without the right storage of information, we would be struggling to have an understanding of where most of our information originated.
