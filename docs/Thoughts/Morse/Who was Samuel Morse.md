### Samuel Morse:
- Morse was a painter and inventor. He began by taking a liking to arts but switched to researching electromagnetism and developing the telegraph because he saw the flaw with communication
- He discovered what electromagnetism is during a voyage from a scientist and used that to design his telegraph
- He struggled with having the signal transmit over distances. After working with a professor, he managed to have his signal travel 13 miles, and began showing his invention to the public.
- He had to fight many lawsuits for patents and the right to be the 'inventor of the telegraph', which took up the majority of his life.
- He invented the Morse code, which is a way of using dots and dashes to send messages over long distances. It paved the way for modern communication.
