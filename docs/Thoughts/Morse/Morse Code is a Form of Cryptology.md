### Morse code was a cipher:
- The receiver of the code would use a key to convert the code to English to read the message. This is a form of cryptology where there was a secret message that needed a key to be decrypted and without the key the message was for the most part hidden
- The main difference between Morse code and substitution was the fact that Morse code was not meant to hide a message be secretive. Rather, it served as a universal language to communicate over long distances in the 1800s.
