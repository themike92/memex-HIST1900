### The flaw in communication at the time:

- Morse did not really have an interest in communication technology at the time and did not see any flaw with the way communication was conducted. This all changed when he experienced its flaw first hand
- This happened because while he was abroad, his wife became sick, so he began returning home but received news that his wife had died 3 days earlier. From this devastation, he was motivated to find a way to communicate faster.
- After hearing that electricity can be passed through a wire almost instantly, he began to take a deep dive into the creation of the telegraph.
- Morse saw that the telegraph would be much faster than a horse-borne message, which could take hours or even days to reach someone. It was 3 days for Morse.
