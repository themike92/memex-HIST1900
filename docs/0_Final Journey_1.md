The most powerful concept that I have learned during this course and that showcases the backbone of the history of the internet is the need to connect and communicate with one another. We cannot imagine a world without communication, as we are social beings. Connection to one another allows us to share ideas, stories, knowledge and so much more, without it, our world would not be where it is today. Let us begin our journey as we look into what media is and represents.

The reason we are beginning with media to show how the world needs communication is that media is the backbone of connecting and communicating. Dating back to ancient times, media were used to convey all sorts of things such as stories, events, knowledge, art, and much more. Without media, we would have no means of communicating or connecting.

From this, we can see that media is what allows us to "Express feelings to one another." Going along this journey, covering the most important aspect of communication first is key, as we continue on this journey we will move to different types of media used for communication, but they will all stem back to 'What is media'. 

The next stop on our journey is Morse code. Morse code is a unique way we communicate and is a type of media hence its linkage. Morse code was a collection of symbols used to communicate over the telegraph. It can be directly linked to media as it conveys a message. It is a short, but important stop along our journey. 

Our next stop covers why Morse code was created and why was it so revolutionary. This directly relates to the need to connect and communicate because Morse created his code to allow for quick and easy messages to be sent far distances using the telegraph.  In the 1800s, the only means of communication were by messenger or a letter by horseback, which was slow and ineffective.

The need for a fast way to communicate was sparked and Morse code and the telegraph was created. This is a key stop in the journey as we dive deeper into the development of communication.

Continuing on this amazing journey, our next stop is the benefits of a connected world. This stems from Morse's code because it highlights why Morse created the telegraph and the benefits of his creation. This directly pertains to the need to connect and communicate, as it covers why the world needs to be connected. With the world connected, countries can easily communicate and coordinate important tasks such as trading. This type of communication also opens a gateway into cultures and different ideas, stories, etc., being shared among people all around the world. Being connected around the world also lead to power, as having control and connection all around the globe was something never seen before.

Moving on to our next stop, we will take a look at the capabilities of the web. This can be connected to the benefits of a connected world because the capabilities of the web showcased how connection and communication affect the world. This is quite a jump from our previous stops, but an important one, as it will show us what having a connection with everyone looks like.

The web is a gateway into an intertwined online world. The connections are endless, and the communication possibilities are unimaginable. The web has revolutionized the way we communicate with one another and the way we access information. It is a key stop along our journey, as it is a representation of years of improving communication and connection.

The next stop is the Bulletin board system. The capabilities of the web links to BBSs because of the way both heavily improved communication and connection in the world. The BBSs take place before the web, but they are crucial to stop at because they are the backbone of social media nowadays. The BBSs were unique because it was the first time a technology allowed communities of people to communicate with each other over computer networks. Similar to today in the way we can contact anyone on social media, BBSs were a way for people to leave messages for others to read, showcasing the need for connection and communication. This is another key stop as it was the base for social media and showcased early technological connections.

Nearing the end of this journey, one of our last stops will be looking at how technology changes. This stems from BBSs as it covers how things like the BBSs changed over time and became what they are today, such as social media. It is important to go over how technology changes to better understand the reason behind the change and where it may take us in the future.

Relating this to the key topic of the need for communication and connection, the crucial factor in technological change is to improve the way we communicate and how much connection we have.

The last stop in this educational and delightful journey is a dive into what ARPANET was and how it affected communication and connection. This links to how technology changes because ARPANET opened the door to modern technology. This is a backtrack from some of our previous stops, but it is one of the most crucial topics to cover as it is the basis for computers, which are what we use nowadays to communicate and connect.

- ![[What is ARPANET#^2383c4]]

ARPANET was a network that allowed computers to be connected. It was originally developed for American military defence to allow for a better and faster way to communicate through the army. This is directly related to the need for communication and connection, as America felt a weak point in this aspect of its military, so it began to improve it.

This takes us to the end of our journey, which I hope was educational. We began at the bases of communication and connection which is media and worked our way through Morse code and the telegraph which improved those aspects. Then we took a look at the benefits of a connected world, swiftly moving onto the capabilities of the web. Then we covered how BBSs affected connection and communication, then we took a shot at how technology changes and lastly covered ARPANET, which was the bases for computer connection. This journey outlined how the need for communication and connection was the most powerful topic learned and showcased through the history of the internet.
