- He was recognized for creating revolutionary calculating engines.

> The calculating engines of English mathematician Charles Babbage (1791-1871) are among the most celebrated icons in the prehistory of computing.[^1]

- This is the beginning of a calculator. Babbage wondered if a machine could be used to do calculations rather than a human. As the telegraph grew, he could see the use of electricity in his machines.

> In 1821 Babbage invented the Difference Engine to compile mathematical tables. On completing it in 1832, he conceived the idea of a better machine that could perform not just one mathematical task but any kind of calculation.[^1]

- This is considered the 'first computer'.

> This was the Analytical Engine (1856), which was intended as a general symbol manipulator, and had some of the characteristics of todayâ€™s computers.[^1]

- He was unable to fully construct his idea of the 'first computer' and we wouldnt see another device like it until the 1900s.
 
> Despite his many achievements, the failure to construct his calculating machines, and in particular the failure of the government to support his work[^1]
