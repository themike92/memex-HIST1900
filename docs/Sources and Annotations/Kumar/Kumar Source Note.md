### Summary & Key Takeaways

- Kumar outlines the history of libraries and catalogues, explaining in great detail all the inventions and improvements to sorting knowledge. Kumar begins by outlining the main tools a library uses to sort all its acquired knowledge, which is classification as well as the catalogue. A library's catalogue is extremely important in the search for items, and it is the part of a library that is always growing. Libraries began to be organized through tablets, then in the 17th century, the Bodleian catalogue emerged, the first of its kind. As cataloguing grew, libraries began to cooperate and codes/rules were created known as the AACR (Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules) to better improve the process. During the late 20th century, computers began to be implemented in the catalogue-making process and the OPAC (Online Public Access Catalogue). The ability to have access to a catalogue online allowed libraries to connect and create joint catalogues and the user interface was greatly improved allowing for easier ways to search. All the new creations and new ways to search through catalogues show how important it is for the info to be stored and for it to be stored correctly.
