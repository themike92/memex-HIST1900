### Summary & Key Takeaways

- In the article, there was a brief description of the origins of the Caesar shift and how it worked. It was an early way to encrypt a message, "The Caesar Cipher technique is one of the earliest and simplest methods of encryption technique" (GeeksforGeeks 1). In Roman times, Julius Caesar would send messages to his army officers. He created a way to cipher his messages so that if the enemy would get their hands on it, they would not be able to read it unless they decrypted it. It worked by adding a shift to the alphabet, this would shift all the letters around where for example A would become B if the shift was 1. Unless someone knew the shift number, they would have to take time trying to forcefully break the code. Because of its simplicity, it was not a safe way to encrypt a message, as it was not too difficult to break. After it many new methods emerged over time, but the Caesar Cipher was one of the first.
