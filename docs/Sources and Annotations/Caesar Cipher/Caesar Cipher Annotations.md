- Very simple to preform and decode as well.

## Source 
> substitution cipher, i.e., each letter of a given text is replaced by a letter with a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.[^1]

- Keeping information about army's secret is important as it could lead to an advantage.


## Source 
> Julius Caesar, who apparently used it to communicate with his officials.[^1]

- At the time it was created, it was easy to make a cipher using this method.

## Source 
> Can be physically implemented, such as with a set of rotating disks or a set of cards, known as a scytale, which can be useful in certain situations.[^1]

- Because it is a simple shift of the alphabet it can be open to attacks.

## Source 
> Vulnerable to known-plaintext attacks, where an attacker has access to both the encrypted and unencrypted versions of the same messages.[^1]
