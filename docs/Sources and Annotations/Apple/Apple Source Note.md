### Summary & Key Takeaways

- In 1976, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak established Apple. They started by creating and releasing the Apple 1, a desktop computer with a single motherboard that was pre-assembled. The Macintosh, a personal computer with a built-in screen, a GUI, and several software programs, was one of the most well-known and influential devices that they would later introduce in 1984 as they gained fame. It became one of the most popular computers on the market very soon, and signalled the start of a radical social change in the tech industry. The iMac, which is well recognized in today's globe, was then released by Apple. The iMac was a strong seller, and Apple went on to develop many digital tools for its users to use.
