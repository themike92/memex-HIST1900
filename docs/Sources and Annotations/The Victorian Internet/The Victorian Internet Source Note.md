### Summary & Key Takeaways

- Chappe created the first telegraph, using black and white panels to transmit messages. Telegraph stations were a new invention that allowed 98 different combinations. The telegraph was seen as revolutionary and people began looking at its profitability. Many different inventions of an electrical telegraph were created, but none ever came into fruition. The Galvanometer which indicates the flow of current and the voltaic battery were created and both could be used as an electric telegraph.  Morse began to make significant progress on the telegraph and improved the code it used to convert and receive messages. Many countries began creating interconnections between them, so messages could be sent between them. This new cable was a success and messages were able to be sent. People had the idea of building a transatlantic telegraph and knew that it would be extremely beneficial. The cable worked for around a month before it failed. Fields was tasked with laying a new cable, and the Atlantic Telegraph company planned on improving its mistakes and had all the knowledge needed to build a working wire.  The telegraph continued to grow overtime with new inventions and improvements. The internet is similar to the telegraph, as it allows people to communicate across great distances using interconnected networks. There are many parallels between the telegraph and the internet, showing how they impacted society in similar ways.
