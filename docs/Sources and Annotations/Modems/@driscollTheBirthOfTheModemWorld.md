# The Early Part of Internet History That People Don’t Talk About
URL: https://issues.org/prehistory-social-media-modem-world-driscoll/

Important to note as, nowadays the term 'internet' cannot be placed on one specific thing. The current day internet sprung from 'the internet', which is the original beginning grounds.

> Yet the internet of today is not a stable object with a single, coherent history. It is a dynamic socio-technical phenomenon that came into being during the 1990s, at the intersection of hundreds of regional, national, commercial, and cooperative networks—only one of which was previously known as “the internet.”[^1]

What the author is saying here is that the artificial history of the internet doesn't take into account the personal computers people used and community networks that helped shaped the internet.

What the author is hinting at here is that in order for the internet to become what it has become, the modem was a key component in its history. It is what allowed people to communicate with each other and connect to one another. It's what the internet needed to go from being a mainly governmental devices to an average Joe device.

> Modem owners knew themselves as a separate class of computer users, capable of traversing the emerging byways of cyberspace. The networks that they frequented came to be known, collectively, as the “modem world.”[^1]
