### Summary & Key Takeaways

- In Dooley's A revolutionary Cipher, He gives us an intro to cryptography and cryptanalysis. Dooley begins by explaining the origins of secret writing and covers many important terms such as Steganography, plaintext, ciphertext, encoding, cryptogram, decoding, cryptanalyst, and many more. He illustrates the difference between a hidden message and an encrypted one, saying encrypted messages are completely visible to the human eye. Humans tend to write important things down, so they want privacy when sending messages, Dooley explains, "Human needs and desires that demand privacy among two or more people in the midst of social life must inevitably lead to cryptology wherever men thrive and wherever they write."(Dooley 5). He tells the story of Mary Butler Wenwood, who got caught with an encrypted letter, and when it was decrypted it had important information about the American army. Dooley explains how important it is for governments to keep information encrypted because if this information was to be revealed it would be devastating. Dooley takes a deep dive into the comparison of a code and a cipher. A code is something that has a code to represent a message, such as a number that represents a word. A cipher will use a set of symbols or a shift in the alphabet, and the message will be written using these. Dooley explains how important it is to keep the codebooks or cipher key hidden, as it is the only way to decrypt the message. He ends by explaining how keys word for ciphers and the different ways to decrypt a cipher.
