### Summary & Key Takeaways

- Morse began his career as a painter and took to learning arts. It was not until his wife's untimely death where he began to see the flaws in communication. He was on a voyage where he learned that electromagnetism would allow a message to be sent instantly from one place to another. While building his telegraph, he ran into the problem that most people did when building a telegraph, which is distance. With the help of a professor, he was able to get his telegraph to send a message 13 miles and began his public showing. He is widely known for creating the language used for telegraphs, Morse code, which is still used to this day. Many countries around the world began to use Morse's telegraph, and he became a decorated man. He spent a lot of his life after the telegraph, fighting for the rights to be the 'inventor of the telegraph'.
