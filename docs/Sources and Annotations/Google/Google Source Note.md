### Summary & Key Takeaways

- Page and Brin created their search engine out of a dorm room at the university of Stanford. They called it google after the number, as it represented the amount of information they want to store on the internet. Google had a unique algorithm based on a program they developed called PageRank. It worked by looking at amount of pages, importance of pages that linked back to the original site. This was the first algorithm that created a ranking rather than just looking for keywords. Google had many investors, one of which being Jeff Bezos. One idea Google said they were going to stick by no matter how big they grew was "Don't be Evil." and they created the means to do so, with different sections of their company dedicated to regulating things of that sort. Over the span of 4â€“5 years, google grew from a million-dollar company to a multi-billion dollar company and became a household name.
