##### 2.1 The Birth of the Web: A Hero's story:

- Page 40: The web represents a cultural change and is a revolutionary invention that would go on to break down many of the current barriers in society. Berners-Lee wrote a proposal in 1989 about an information management system, and from that the web has grown to be huge.
- Page 41: Tim Berners-Lee gave his invention for free, for the greater good of humanity. With many revolutionary inventions the creator tends to not reap the benefits of its commercial ability, rather they give their invention to help humanity grow and solve problems. Many articles wrote about how the inventor was connected to the invention of the web. 
- Page 42: The story of the web is eerily similar to a hero's story, where the hero gains some power and returns to a new and improved life.

##### [[The Webs Journey]]:

- Page 42: The reason the beginning of the web has been closely related to the story of a hero is because society needs a story to fill in the blanks or the mystery that surrounds it. The hero story is in response to the social need of meaningful stories that are organized and give sense to reality.
- Page 43-50: The beginning of the web can be related to a hero's story. 
	**a) The departure**
	- This means that Berners-Lee was called to create the web. He had quite the background in upcoming technology of the time and this is what began him on his adventure 
	**b) The initiation**
	- This phase is where Berners idea of the web gets initially rejected, and he is on the quest to persuade people of his idea and initiate the creation of the web. 
	**c) The return**
	- In this stage Berners will be preparing and laying the final touches on the invention before it will be released to the public. As the web unfolded, Berners had to protect his invention from big companies trying to profit on his hard work. 
	
	In the ending stage, society gets to bathe in Berners invention, and he slowly loses recognition as the web begins to grow.


##### 2.1.2 The Biography of the Web as a Myth-building narrative:

- Page 51: [[Need for a Story]]. Berners-Lee depicted the web as a neutral entity not plagued by infectious companies, rather an implicit goodness.
- Page 52: [[The Difference Between the Web and the Internet]]

##### 2.2 Questioning The Myth of the Web: Media imaginaries and Web history:

- Page 52: When we take a deeper dive into the web, we can see that its clear and simple narrative that is pushed in society is all but wrong, as the true creation is complicated and contradicts the narrative.
- Page 53: The web can be thought of as a _net-meta medium,_ which is a system that organizes and links already existing media. The internet and web are often shown to be utilities and are seen for the usefulness to do other things through them. [[The Web became something unexpected]]

##### 2.2.2 Retracing Old media in the World Wide Web:

- Page 56: Berners-Lee referred to many other media to describe the origin of the web. This is important because it shows that the web did not come from one central piece of media rather a multitude of media.
- Page 57: He related the web to an adventure game that had many different links between rooms inside the game. He also related it to a book, which is one of the oldest methods of organizing information. He also related the web to a telephony, which is telephone networks, which he related to the chaotic growth of the web.
