- This new technology opened the opportunity for many revolutionary technologies. It also helped with travel times and became a staple of early electrical technology.

> the telegraph revolutionized long-distance communication.[^1]

- Language of the telegraph, since people could not physically speak to each other.

> Morse code assigned a set of dots and dashes to each letter of the English alphabet and allowed for the simple transmission of complex messages across telegraph lines.[^1]

- Shows the development of technology to solve a major problem of long distance travels.

> ancient civilizations such as those in China, Egypt and Greece used drumbeats, signal fires or smoke signals to exchange information between far-flung points.[^1]

- The battery would later become what is used for nearly every device.

> Alessandro Volta invented the battery, which reliably stored an electric current and allowed the current to be used in a controlled environment.[^1]

- This was revolutionary as it allowed for coordinated travel along railways, decreasing the time spend travelling.
 
> Their system was soon being used for railroad signaling in Britain.[^1]

- Similar to cryptology, it is a new form of media that is presented to the world.

> Morse code. The code assigned letters in the alphabet and numbers a set of dots (short marks) and dashes (long marks) based on the frequency of use;[^1]

- Relates to cryptology and cryptanalysts.

> Initially, the code, when transmitted over the telegraph system, was rendered as marks on a piece of paper that the telegraph operator would then translate back into English.[^1]

- Major as it allowed for cross continental communication.

> 1866 the first permanent telegraph cable had been successfully laid across the Atlantic Ocean[^1]
