- The current day web has become a place to express yourself, where you stand politically etc., rather than a tool to expand your ideas and share thoughts.

- Much of today's internet is what people think of something rather than what they know of something. In many cases this is extremely harmful as someone's false thought of something is truth to another.

- We have lost the concept of original thinking nowadays. In moderntimes,s people just copy each other and maybe write a little bit about what they think. But their ideas have already been influenced by other peoples.

- This is an interesting point which I agree with. If we are able to take ourselves out of a clogged internet and grow a nice complex garden, we will be able to learn a lot and influence others.
