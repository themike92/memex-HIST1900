- Having a cable as important as the telegraph connecting to Canada would allow for great opportunities for Canada and North America.

- The Anglo-American Telegraph Company was in charge of many of the initial telegraph operations. To have a place in Canada for them to operate gives benefits to Canadians.

> In 1854 the New York, Newfoundland and London Telegraph Company was granted a 50-year monopoly on telegraphy in Newfoundland, subsequently assumed by the Anglo-American Telegraph Company (AAT)[^1]

- Many connections allowed different areas to be connected to larger cities. Allows for a big benefit as those areas can now connect to larger areas.

> In 1877 a line was constructed from Avondale to Trinity, Catalina and Bonavista, and in 1878 a line was run from LaPoile to St. George's, Humbermouth and Tilt Cove.[^1]

- Laying the lines along the railway allowed for any areas near to or with access to the railways to be connected to the main line. Having the line occupying Newfoundland is important as it has access to the Atlantic Ocean.

## Source 
> the government telegraph and telephone operations (the later largely in remote areas) were transferred to Canadian National Railways, to be operated by Canadian National Telecommunications (CNT), which eventually purchased the operations of Western Union in Newfoundland, as well as some private telephone exchanges in central and western Newfoundland.[^1]
