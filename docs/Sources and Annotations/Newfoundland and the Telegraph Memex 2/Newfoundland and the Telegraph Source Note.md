### Summary & Key Takeaways

- Newfoundland and Labrador was a key location in the history of the Atlantic cable. Having this cable in Canada posed a great benefit to not only Canadians, but all of North America. The Anglo-American telegraph company was given the rights to operate in Canada, which gives way for Canadians to get involved. As the railway was being worked on and extended, an agreement was made with the government to line a wire along with it, which allowed all of Canada to be connected. Newfoundland and Labrador was where the submarine lines were tested to ensure they would be able to cross the Atlantic.
