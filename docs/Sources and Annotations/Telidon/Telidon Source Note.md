### Summary & Key Takeaways

- The piece discusses Telidon, an information processing and communication medium created by Canadian researchers at the federal Department of Communications in Ottawa that combined elements of television, telephone, and computer. It was designed to give Canada a leg up in the information technology sector. The article continued by describing the various ways this program is used. Videotex, teletext, and stand-alone systems were all distinct types of computer-based communication and information processing, each with a unique way for a user to interact with the program. Companies like Bell Canada continued to be interested in this technology despite the challenges.
