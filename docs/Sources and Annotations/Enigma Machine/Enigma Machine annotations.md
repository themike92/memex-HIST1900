> With the advent of the 1920s people saw the need for a mechanical encryption device. Taking a substitution cipher and then rotating it was identified as an ideal solution.
>
>> This idea developed from the first world war as it was important to keep position and amount of supplies a secret from the enemy.

> To encrypt a plaintext character it would first be passed through the plugboard
>
>> The plugboard acted as the key and is what allowed the cipher to be made.

> the next task is to determine the actual key when the day settings are not available.
>
>> The enigma machine had a different cipher everyday and anyone who was using the machine had to switch to that key.
