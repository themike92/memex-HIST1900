### Summary & Key Takeaways

- In Cryptography Made Simple, author Smart took an analytical look at the enigma machine. He described how the machine worked and the math behind it, "With the advent of the 1920s people saw the need for a mechanical encryption device. Taking a substitution cipher and then rotating it was identified as an ideal solution." (Smart 141). It begins with a cipher key which is then transferred to the plug board, the user will type their message, and it will be encrypted as the keys on the keyboard connect to the correct letters. The mechanical aspect of the machine made it extremely efficient and reliable.
