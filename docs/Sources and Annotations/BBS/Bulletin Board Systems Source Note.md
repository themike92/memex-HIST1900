### Summary & Key Takeaways

- Before the internet, there were computer networks called bulletin board systems (BBSs). They were operated by individuals or communities, and users could access them by dialling in using a modem. They were communities of people talking to each other about shared interests. It acted similar to a bulletin board at a coffee shop. A popular bulletin board was created by Ward Christensen and Randy Suess, who wanted a way to keep up with their community without being in person. A user would log in and send a message to be read by others or read the messages of others. BBSs had a big impact on how the internet evolved. They contributed to the spread of the idea of online communities, which subsequently developed into a key element of the Internet. BBSs had a significant impact on the development of the internet's culture and technology, and their influence may still be felt in a variety of contemporary online networking and communication practices.
