What I wanted to get out of this class was the reason behind the innovation of past technologies, problem-solving when conflicts were raised, the collaboration and networking that took place to develop these technologies, the steps it took to get to the internet we have now and to see the creativity in these technologies. I believe my goal was accomplished as I dived into many of the different inventions and the people behind them, and we will explore more in-depth why through a journey.

To begin this journey, we will look at Claude Chappe and his telegraph. It is an important place to start, as understanding why and how the telegraph was created is important for understanding later inventions. He created his telegraph in the 18th century to better communicate over long distances. It allowed messages to travel across France at the time and began to expand to all of Europe.

This new technology was revolutionary and falls in the line with what I expected to get out of this course. Claude's telegraph showed creativity and innovation in communication for the time and was revolutionary for later inventions. As we continue in this journey we will be stemming from this invention looking at other people and new technologies.

The next step in this journey is to talk about a very influential man. Samuel Morse connects to Claude Chappe as they both worked on the telegraph and improved connections over long distances. Morse worked on creating the telegraph to tackle the problem of long-distance communication. He used innovation to learn about electromagnetism to send electrical signals over long distances.

He also used creativity to develop a language to communicate using this device called Morse code, which was a set of dots and dashes that would allow messages to be encrypted and decrypted. Samuel Morse is an important stop along our journey as he was extremely influential as his inventions sparked the start of faster communication across the world.

Moving on to our next stop in our journey, we will dive into how the telegraph was revolutionary. This directly links to the previous note, as Morse and Claude's telegraph was a big step in connection around the globe. The telegraph was a new technology that allowed electrical messages to be sent far distances and forever revolutionized communication. This directly relates to the origin of the internet, as without the invention of the telegraph the internet would not be what it is today. The telegraph was a key milestone in the steps to the internet and web that we have nowadays.

Next, we will look at the benefits of a connected world. This relates to the previous notes, as they all related to the telegraph, which allowed the world to become a more connected place and revolutionized communication. With the world being connected, countries can readily interact and organize crucial operations like trade, military and much more. It was important to develop the world network as it allowed access to many cultures and ideas, tales, and other things that people all over the world share. It is another key step in the origin of the internet, as nowadays we do not think twice about how interconnected our world is.

Continuing, our next stop will take a peek at conflicts with network connections. This links to our previous note, as with new connections being built around the world, we are bound to run into problems and conflicts surrounding the new way to communicate. As people have more access to the internet and more people are connected, security and trust issues arise.

This is an important topic to look at because it encapsulates the problem-solving aspect of the origin of the internet. Without these conflicts, many of the laws and rules we have nowadays would not be present.

The next stop on our journey takes a jump to a popular company called Apple. It can be linked to our previous note, as Apple allowed people to have their own devices and connect, and conflicts were bound to arise. Apple provided the world with many of the first personal computers, this innovation in the tech industry gave way to the devices we have nowadays.

Without Apple's creativity and innovation, devices such as the iPhone or iMac would not be possible and not have left the mark they have already left. Apple is an important company to cover as it is something we see every day and understanding why and how is important to the history of technology.

Moving on to our next stop, we will look at another powerful company that forever shaped the internet and web as we know it. Google and Apple are closely related as they are some of the most powerful and influential companies in the history of the internet and are extremely important to cover. Google began as a search engine company and was able to grow its brand through innovation and creativity. 


  - (From note) ![[Googles Domination#^761405]]


They came up with a new way to rank pages for users when a search was completed. Nowadays, we use Google every day to learn things, and Google has shaped the web as we know it. Without Google, we would be missing a key component in the origin of the internet.

This takes us to the end of our journey, as our last topic will be what I define the internet as. This links to all of our previous notes, as they were all steps toward the internet. I believe this is important to cover, as it allows people to see how I view the internet and its impact.

This course began with the goal of reaching an understanding of the internet, and I believe I have achieved this and my knowledge is contained within this note. The Internet is full of innovation, collaboration and creativity, without those components, we would not have the Internet.

This is the end of the journey. What I expected to get out of this course was achieved through research and taking dives into unique topics. This journey allows us to take a look at how innovation, creativity, problem-solving and collaboration were key factors in the origin of the Internet. I began this journey with little to no knowledge as to what to expect and what I would end up learning. By the end, all of my questions were answered, and I know so much more about the internet than I did at the start. Thank you for joining me on this journey, it was a wonderful ride.
