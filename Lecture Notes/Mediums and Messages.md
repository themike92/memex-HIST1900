### Mediums and Messages:

-   **Medium:** Something that carries something else, such as a message
-   Media comes in different classes/kind of things
-   Whoever decides what is important, has power because media has a strong effect
-   Classifications: reflect and direct our thinking, the way we order is the way we thinkÂ 
-   The medium for the message is as important as the message, the medium is the thing that carries the message
-   The way a message is classified has implications of power, control and discipline
-   The infrastructure for writing spills out and impacts society
-   Libraries allow for the collection of knowledge
-   There is no natural way to organize info and documents
-   People who find some way to hold power, the way people found a way to categorize info reflected the way they already viewed the world.
