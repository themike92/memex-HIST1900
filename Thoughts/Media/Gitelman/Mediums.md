### How is Media conveyed:
- A medium is what allows media to be conveyed, it is the way in which media is conveyed. This means that things like paintings, drawings, poems, stories, books, tales, etc. are all mediums for messages.
- Gitelman explains how media is misused in place of the word medium, "Forget that the word media is rightly plural, not singular. Media are. A medium is" (Gitelman 2). It is important to remember that media is a broad concept and cannot be focused onto one specific area. It is a medium in which we humans communicate, express ourselves, etc. without mediums, media would not be conveyed.
