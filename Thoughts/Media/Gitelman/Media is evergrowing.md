### Media is constantly evolving:

- Many new revolutionary pieces of media from the past have become useless nowadays and new media is constantly being created. Gitelman explains this, "The success of all media depends at some get level on inattention or "blindness" to the media technologies themselves" (Gitelman 6). When we completely comprehend how a piece of media functions, we lose the novelty of utilizing it and instead focus more on how to improve it.
- Every new piece of media is always improved upon over and over again. Gitelman illustrates this, "The introduction of new media, these instances suggest, is never entirely revolutionary: new media are less points of epistemic rupture than they are socially embedded sites for the ongoing negotiation of meaning as such" (Gitelman 6). Every piece of media that is produced must be developed over time. No single piece of media can instantly transform the entire globe. This is comparable to how we would likely not be able to understand a groundbreaking piece of media if an alien presented it to us.
