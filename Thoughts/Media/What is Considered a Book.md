##### A great question was asked during the booklab, "What would you define as a book".

- Is a book strictly defined as a paper lined thing containing information? What about a scroll? How about a set of clay tablets? How about an iPhone?
- These are all great questions that had me thinking, "What do I define as a book?",
	- Is it just something that holds information, well a verbal message or story holds information. Does it have to by a physical piece right in my hand, what about a website on the internet or a online book?
	- My conclusion is unknown as of now. For me, a book must hold some piece of information in any way shape or form.
