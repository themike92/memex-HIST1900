### The invention of new automatic computers in the 1800s:
- As mathematics became more complex, the time and effort required to perform calculations by hand increased. Having a machine that can spit out the answer in a really short amount of time would allow for more in depth math research, this is the reason behind Babbage's devices.
-  During the mid 1800s there was a rapid expansion of industry, and the need to compute complex calculations became increasingly important for manufacturing and commerce. 
- Accurate calculations were necessary for determining the cost and profitability of goods, and for designing and building machines for production.
- More scientific research was being done and having a device to automate many of the time-consuming calculations is beneficial
