### How did Computers and the internet affect libraries:
- Before computers libraries used a physical catalogue system and when that system was updated a new print of the catalogue would have to be made. This took a lot of time and effort as the process was slow. With the introduction of computers, libraries were able to have online catalogues, which could be updated much easier and faster.
- This opened the opportunity for libraries to combine catalogues to allow for a deeper selection of material. 
- The internet allowed a user to search for what they were looking for much easier than before, improving user experience.
