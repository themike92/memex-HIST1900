### The Current day web:

- Today, we no longer understand what it is to think creatively. Nowadays, people merely copy one another and occasionally express their opinions in brief writing. However, other people have already had an impact on their thoughts.
- The web is filled with opinions and ideas based on false or unknown truths, which is heavily affecting the web as we know it. The more corruption in true ideas the less we have to reference when trying to learn
- Many people use the web to post what they think about a topic but do not have anything to back what they say, this clogs the web with misleading information
