### Morse Code:
- Morse code was created by Samuel Morse in order to communicate through the telegraph.
- It uses a dash and dot system, where combinations of the both would represent one of the 26 letters of the English alphabet, and it used frequency of the letter to determine how many lines and dashes to use. The dashes would be a longer electrical signal and a dot would be a short one. This allowed for long distance communication
- Morse code can still be seen used today by many naval ships, although it is heavily outshone by the internet. It was a key piece in both world wars as it allowed officers to quickly communicate.
