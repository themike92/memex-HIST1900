### Why encrypt a message?:
- A message is a piece of information that contains the knowledge of a person. It can be seen as a piece of media that needs to be shared with a specific other person. It is important to have privacy for a message due to those facts. From this the art of secret writing was created
- During war or conflict between people, getting hands on a message they are trying to send can win the fight entire, so it is extremely important for messages to be hidden from the eyes of the wrong people.
- Messages hold knowledge, and knowledge is power, so having encrypted messages can block others from that power, as Dooley explains, "Governments, the military, and people in business have desired to keep their communications secret ever since the invention of writing. Spies, lovers, and diplomats all have secrets and are desperate to keep them as such." (Dooley 5).
