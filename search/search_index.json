We cannot imagine a world without communication, as we are social beings. Connection to one another allows us to share ideas, stories, knowledge and so much more, without it, our world would not be where it is today. Let us begin our journey as we look into what media is and represents.</p> <p>The reason we are beginning with media to show how the world needs communication is that media is the backbone of connecting and communicating. Dating back to ancient times, media were used to convey all sorts of things such as stories, events, knowledge, art, and much more. Without media, we would have no means of communicating or connecting.</p> <ul> <li></li> </ul> <p>From this, we can see that media is what allows us to \"Express feelings to one another.\" Going along this journey, covering the most important aspect of communication first is key, as we continue on this journey we will move to different types of media used for communication, but they will all stem back to 'What is media'. </p> <p>The next stop on our journey is Morse code. Morse code is a unique way we communicate and is a type of media hence its linkage. Morse code was a collection of symbols used to communicate over the telegraph. It can be directly linked to media as it conveys a message. It is a short, but important stop along our journey. </p> <p>Our next stop covers why Morse code was created and why was it so revolutionary. This directly relates to the need to connect and communicate because Morse created his code to allow for quick and easy messages to be sent far distances using the telegraph.  In the 1800s, the only means of communication were by messenger or a letter by horseback, which was slow and ineffective. </p> <ul> <li></li> </ul> <p>The need for a fast way to communicate was sparked and Morse code and the telegraph was created. This is a key stop in the journey as we dive deeper into the development of communication.</p> <p>Continuing on this amazing journey, our next stop is the benefits of a connected world. This stems from Morse's code because it highlights why Morse created the telegraph and the benefits of his creation. This directly pertains to the need to connect and communicate, as it covers why the world needs to be connected. With the world connected, countries can easily communicate and coordinate important tasks such as trading. This type of communication also opens a gateway into cultures and different ideas, stories, etc., being shared among people all around the world. Being connected around the world also lead to power, as having control and connection all around the globe was something never seen before.</p> <p>Moving on to our next stop, we will take a look at the capabilities of the web. This can be connected to the benefits of a connected world because the capabilities of the web showcased how connection and communication affect the world. This is quite a jump from our previous stops, but an important one, as it will show us what having a connection with everyone looks like.</p> <ul> <li></li> </ul> <p>The web is a gateway into an intertwined online world. The connections are endless, and the communication possibilities are unimaginable. The web has revolutionized the way we communicate with one another and the way we access information. It is a key stop along our journey, as it is a representation of years of improving communication and connection.</p> <p>The next stop is the Bulletin board system. The capabilities of the web links to BBSs because of the way both heavily improved communication and connection in the world. The BBSs take place before the web, but they are crucial to stop at because they are the backbone of social media nowadays. The BBSs were unique because it was the first time a technology allowed communities of people to communicate with each other over computer networks. Similar to today in the way we can contact anyone on social media, BBSs were a way for people to leave messages for others to read, showcasing the need for connection and communication. This is another key stop as it was the base for social media and showcased early technological connections.</p> <p>Nearing the end of this journey, one of our last stops will be looking at how technology changes. This stems from BBSs as it covers how things like the BBSs changed over time and became what they are today, such as social media. It is important to go over how technology changes to better understand the reason behind the change and where it may take us in the future.</p> <ul> <li></li> </ul> <p>Relating this to the key topic of the need for communication and connection, the crucial factor in technological change is to improve the way we communicate and how much connection we have.</p> <p>The last stop in this educational and delightful journey is a dive into what ARPANET was and how it affected communication and connection. This links to how technology changes because ARPANET opened the door to modern technology. This is a backtrack from some of our previous stops, but it is one of the most crucial topics to cover as it is the basis for computers, which are what we use nowadays to communicate and connect.</p> <ul> <li></li> </ul> <p>ARPANET was a network that allowed computers to be connected. It was originally developed for American military defence to allow for a better and faster way to communicate through the army. This is directly related to the need for communication and connection, as America felt a weak point in this aspect of its military, so it began to improve it.</p> <p>This takes us to the end of our journey, which I hope was educational. We began at the bases of communication and connection which is media and worked our way through Morse code and the telegraph which improved those aspects. Then we took a look at the benefits of a connected world, swiftly moving onto the capabilities of the web. Then we covered how BBSs affected connection and communication, then we took a shot at how technology changes and lastly covered ARPANET, which was the bases for computer connection. This journey outlined how the need for communication and connection was the most powerful topic learned and showcased through the history of the internet.</p>"},{"location":"0_Final%20Journey_2/","title":"0 Final Journey 2","text":""},{"location":"0_Final%20Journey_2/#the-journey-between-websitethoughtstelegraphclaude-chappes-telegraph-and-websitethoughtsinternetwhat-do-i-define-the-internet-as","title":"The Journey Between website/Thoughts/Telegraph/Claude Chappes Telegraph and website/Thoughts/Internet/What do I define the Internet as","text":"<ul> <li>Claude Chappes Telegraph</li> <li>Who was Samuel Morse</li> <li>How was the Telegraph Revolutionary</li> <li>The Benefits of a connected world</li> <li>Conflicts with Network Connections</li> <li>Why Apple was so Dominate</li> <li>Googles Domination</li> <li>What do I define the Internet as</li> </ul> <p>What I wanted to get out of this class was the reason behind the innovation of past technologies, problem-solving when conflicts were raised, the collaboration and networking that took place to develop these technologies, the steps it took to get to the internet we have now and to see the creativity in these technologies. I believe my goal was accomplished as I dived into many of the different inventions and the people behind them, and we will explore more in-depth why through a journey.</p> <p>To begin this journey, we will look at Claude Chappe and his telegraph. It is an important place to start, as understanding why and how the telegraph was created is important for understanding later inventions. He created his telegraph in the 18th century to better communicate over long distances. It allowed messages to travel across France at the time and began to expand to all of Europe.</p> <ul> <li>(From note) </li> </ul> <p>This new technology was revolutionary and falls in the line with what I expected to get out of this course. Claude's telegraph showed creativity and innovation in communication for the time and was revolutionary for later inventions. As we continue in this journey we will be stemming from this invention looking at other people and new technologies.</p> <p>The next step in this journey is to talk about a very influential man. Samuel Morse connects to Claude Chappe as they both worked on the telegraph and improved connections over long distances. Morse worked on creating the telegraph to tackle the problem of long-distance communication. He used innovation to learn about electromagnetism to send electrical signals over long distances. </p> <ul> <li>(From note) </li> </ul> <p>He also used creativity to develop a language to communicate using this device called Morse code, which was a set of dots and dashes that would allow messages to be encrypted and decrypted. Samuel Morse is an important stop along our journey as he was extremely influential as his inventions sparked the start of faster communication across the world.</p> <p>Moving on to our next stop in our journey, we will dive into how the telegraph was revolutionary. This directly links to the previous note, as Morse and Claude's telegraph was a big step in connection around the globe. The telegraph was a new technology that allowed electrical messages to be sent far distances and forever revolutionized communication. This directly relates to the origin of the internet, as without the invention of the telegraph the internet would not be what it is today. The telegraph was a key milestone in the steps to the internet and web that we have nowadays.</p> <p>Next, we will look at the benefits of a connected world. This relates to the previous notes, as they all related to the telegraph, which allowed the world to become a more connected place and revolutionized communication. With the world being connected, countries can readily interact and organize crucial operations like trade, military and much more. It was important to develop the world network as it allowed access to many cultures and ideas, tales, and other things that people all over the world share. It is another key step in the origin of the internet, as nowadays we do not think twice about how interconnected our world is.</p> <p>Continuing, our next stop will take a peek at conflicts with network connections. This links to our previous note, as with new connections being built around the world, we are bound to run into problems and conflicts surrounding the new way to communicate. As people have more access to the internet and more people are connected, security and trust issues arise.</p> <ul> <li>(From note) </li> </ul> <p>This is an important topic to look at because it encapsulates the problem-solving aspect of the origin of the internet. Without these conflicts, many of the laws and rules we have nowadays would not be present.</p> <p>The next stop on our journey takes a jump to a popular company called Apple. It can be linked to our previous note, as Apple allowed people to have their own devices and connect, and conflicts were bound to arise. Apple provided the world with many of the first personal computers, this innovation in the tech industry gave way to the devices we have nowadays. </p> <ul> <li>(From note) </li> </ul> <p>Without Apple's creativity and innovation, devices such as the iPhone or iMac would not be possible and not have left the mark they have already left. Apple is an important company to cover as it is something we see every day and understanding why and how is important to the history of technology.</p> <p>Moving on to our next stop, we will look at another powerful company that forever shaped the internet and web as we know it. Google and Apple are closely related as they are some of the most powerful and influential companies in the history of the internet and are extremely important to cover. Google began as a search engine company and was able to grow its brand through innovation and creativity. </p> <ul> <li>(From note) </li> </ul> <p>They came up with a new way to rank pages for users when a search was completed. Nowadays, we use Google every day to learn things, and Google has shaped the web as we know it. Without Google, we would be missing a key component in the origin of the internet.</p> <p>This takes us to the end of our journey, as our last topic will be what I define the internet as. This links to all of our previous notes, as they were all steps toward the internet. I believe this is important to cover, as it allows people to see how I view the internet and its impact. </p> <ul> <li>(From note) </li> </ul> <p>This course began with the goal of reaching an understanding of the internet, and I believe I have achieved this and my knowledge is contained within this note. The Internet is full of innovation, collaboration and creativity, without those components, we would not have the Internet.</p> <p>This is the end of the journey. What I expected to get out of this course was achieved through research and taking dives into unique topics. This journey allows us to take a look at how innovation, creativity, problem-solving and collaboration were key factors in the origin of the Internet. I began this journey with little to no knowledge as to what to expect and what I would end up learning. By the end, all of my questions were answered, and I know so much more about the internet than I did at the start. Thank you for joining me on this journey, it was a wonderful ride.</p>"},{"location":"Map%20of%20Contents/","title":"Map of Contents","text":"<ul> <li>Table of Contents</li>

Paul Baran, a researcher, concluded that a distributed network of computers would be the most robust communication system, which would function as nodes and communicate through an interconnected path of working nodes even with the loss of a node. As the use of the ARPANET grew, the network expanded to other networks. This led to the creation of many new community networks, which had a significant impact on the world. The author notes that if the inventors of the car or the telephone were brought back, they would be surprised to see that the physical components or the initial intent of its use has not changed. They would also be surprised to see that there has been a significant change in the way people use it. The author also discusses the five stages of technological discourse: declarations, prototypes, tools, industries, and widespread practice. Electronic mail was not the intent of the network, but it quickly grew to be the most popular use of the ARPANET. The author predicts four different discourses: scientific technology, business, higher education, and government and goes into detail about what conflicts they may cause or benefits that they would bring. The author notes that the significance of the ARPANET and its derivatives lies not in the networking technology, but in the fundamental shifts in human practices. The article also discusses two critical conflicts that may arise with the network: security and trust. Both of which can be related to today's technology.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Sources%20and%20Annotations/ARPANET/ARPANET%20Source%20Note/#links","title":"Links","text":"<ul> <li>What is ARPANET</li> <li>Conflicts with Network Connections</li> <li>How Technology Changes</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Sources%20and%20Annotations/Apple/%40BriefHistoryApple/","title":"A Brief History of Apple Computers","text":"<p>URL: https://www.thoughtco.com/the-history-of-apple-computers-1991454</p> <p>Founders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak worked out of Jobs' garage at his home in Los Altos, California.1</p>"},{"location":"Sources%20and%20Annotations/Apple/%40BriefHistoryApple/#1-a-brief-history-of-apple-computers-syndication-link","title":"1: A Brief History of Apple Computers | syndication link","text":"<p>Began a shift in the computer market</p> <p>Apple 1, a desktop computer that came as a single motherboard, pre-assembled, unlike other personal computers of that era.1</p>"},{"location":"Sources%20and%20Annotations/Apple/%40BriefHistoryApple/#1-a-brief-history-of-apple-computers-syndication-link_1","title":"1: A Brief History of Apple Computers | syndication link","text":"<p>It was revolutionary for the time and became one of the best selling computers at the time.</p> <p>In 1984, Apple introduced its most successful product yet \u2014 the Macintosh, a personal computer that came with a built-in screen and mouse.1</p> <p>Macintosh was the beginning of a \"revolution in personal computing.\"1</p>"},{"location":"Sources%20and%20Annotations/Apple/%40BriefHistoryApple/#1-a-brief-history-of-apple-computers-syndication-link_2","title":"1: A Brief History of Apple Computers | syndication link","text":"<p>the iMac1</p> <p>over the course of ~15 years apple continued to produce revolutionary devices and continued to dominate the technological market.</p> <p>The iMac was a strong seller, and Apple quickly went to work developing a suite of digital tools for its users1</p> <ol> <li> <p>A Brief History of Apple Computers | syndication link \u21a9\u21a9\u21a9\u21a9\u21a9\u21a9\u21a9\u21a9\u21a9</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"Sources%20and%20Annotations/Apple/Apple%20Source%20Note/","title":"Apple Source Note","text":"<p>Title: @BriefHistoryApple date: 2023-04-08 type: reference</p> <p>tags:: #ModernTech #Technology #Internet #Computers </p>"},{"location":"Sources%20and%20Annotations/Apple/Apple%20Source%20Note/#reference","title":"Reference","text":"<ul> <li>Anon. n.d.

They were operated by individuals or communities, and users could access them by dialling in using a modem. They were communities of people talking to each other about shared interests. It acted similar to a bulletin board at a coffee shop. A popular bulletin board was created by Ward Christensen and Randy Suess, who wanted a way to keep up with their community without being in person. A user would log in and send a message to be read by others or read the messages of others. BBSs had a big impact on how the internet evolved. They contributed to the spread of the idea of online communities, which subsequently developed into a key element of the Internet. BBSs had a significant impact on the development of the internet's culture and technology, and their influence may still be felt in a variety of contemporary online networking and communication practices.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Sources%20and%20Annotations/BBS/Bulletin%20Board%20Systems%20Source%20Note/#links","title":"Links","text":"<ul> <li>The Before Internet</li> <li>Cool ways to look at BBSs</li> <li>BBSs Paved way for Social Media</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Sources%20and%20Annotations/Bush/Bush%20Annotations/","title":"Bush Annotations","text":"<p>Tags:: #Annotations #Bush </p>"},{"location":"Sources%20and%20Annotations/Bush/Bush%20Annotations/#as-we-may-think","title":"As We May Think","text":"<p>URL: https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/</p> <ul> <li>The sheer amount of resources available nowadays makes it hard to decipher between what's truth and what is just an idea.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Sources%20and%20Annotations/Bush/Bush%20Annotations/#source","title":"Source","text":"<p>_The difficulty seems to be, not so much that we publish unduly in view of the extent and variety of present day interests, but rather that publication has been extended far beyond our present ability to make real use of the record.1</p> <ul> <li>These machines although they may be a complicated piece, the fact that parts can easily be interchanged with new or better parts makes it extremely reliable.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Sources%20and%20Annotations/Bush/Bush%20Annotations/#source_1","title":"Source","text":"<p>*In spite of much complexity, they perform reliably.1</p> <ul> <li>Does this cause problems?</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Sources%20and%20Annotations/Bush/Bush%20Annotations/#source_2","title":"Source","text":"<p>*The world has arrived at an age of cheap complex devices of great reliability1</p> <ul> <li>Nowadays, everything needs some sort of proof in order for it to be useful.

Bush begins by looking at how we are in a war with technology, as he explains that many professions have resorted to creating gadgets to help them do their job. Bush explores the idea that technology has in a way taken over our minds as it is all we rely on saying, \"The difficulty seems to be, not so much that we publish unduly in view of the extent and variety of present day interests, but rather that publication has been extended far beyond our present ability to make real use of the record\" (Bush 1). Bush illustrates that new technology is extremely complex, but reliable, and that it is useful to humans. He takes a dive into may of these new technologies, such as a record player or TVs, and comes up with an idea that in the future devices will be extremely powerful. From this he explores the idea that in the future technology will be able to have all the world's knowledge fit in the back of the van and that it will come at a small cost. This is his early prototype to the web. He says \"They will be controlled by a control card or film, they will select their own data and manipulate it in accordance with the instructions thus inserted, they will perform complex arithmetical computations at exceedingly high speeds, and they will record results in such form as to be readily available for distribution or for later further manipulation\" (Bush 4).

It was an early way to encrypt a message, \"The Caesar Cipher technique is one of the earliest and simplest methods of encryption technique\" (GeeksforGeeks 1). In Roman times, Julius Caesar would send messages to his army officers. He created a way to cipher his messages so that if the enemy would get their hands on it, they would not be able to read it unless they decrypted it. It worked by adding a shift to the alphabet, this would shift all the letters around where for example A would become B if the shift was 1. Unless someone knew the shift number, they would have to take time trying to forcefully break the code. Because of its simplicity, it was not a safe way to encrypt a message, as it was not too difficult to break. After it many new methods emerged over time, but the Caesar Cipher was one of the first.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Sources%20and%20Annotations/Caesar%20Cipher/Caesar%20Cipher%20Source%20Note/#links","title":"Links","text":"<ul> <li>Caesar Cipher``</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Sources%20and%20Annotations/Canary%20Islands/%40quevedoTelecommunicationsColonialRivalry2010/","title":"@quevedoTelecommunicationsColonialRivalry2010","text":"<pre><code>Date:{2023-03-07}\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"Sources%20and%20Annotations/Canary%20Islands/%40quevedoTelecommunicationsColonialRivalry2010/#memex2","title":"Memex2","text":""},{"location":"Sources%20and%20Annotations/Canary%20Islands/%40quevedoTelecommunicationsColonialRivalry2010/#canary-islands-dispute","title":"Canary Islands dispute:","text":"<ul> <li> <p>Page 109: There was much interest in the control of northwestern Africa.

It is made up of two halves; cryptography consists of the techniques for creating systems of secret writing and cryptanalysis encompasses the techniques of breaking them. Over the past 2500 years, cryptology has developed numerous types of systems to hide messages and subsequently a rich vocabulary in which to describe them. In this chapter we introduce the reader to the vocabulary of cryptology, explain the differences between codes and ciphers and begin the discussion of how to decipher an unknown message. - Bibliography: Dooley, JF. 2018 Introduction \u2013 A Revolutionary Cipher.

Dooley begins by explaining the origins of secret writing and covers many important terms such as Steganography, plaintext, ciphertext, encoding, cryptogram, decoding, cryptanalyst, and many more. He illustrates the difference between a hidden message and an encrypted one, saying encrypted messages are completely visible to the human eye. Humans tend to write important things down, so they want privacy when sending messages, Dooley explains, \"Human needs and desires that demand privacy among two or more people in the midst of social life must inevitably lead to cryptology wherever men thrive and wherever they write.\"(Dooley 5). He tells the story of Mary Butler Wenwood, who got caught with an encrypted letter, and when it was decrypted it had important information about the American army. Dooley explains how important it is for governments to keep information encrypted because if this information was to be revealed it would be devastating. Dooley takes a deep dive into the comparison of a code and a cipher. A code is something that has a code to represent a message, such as a number that represents a word. A cipher will use a set of symbols or a shift in the alphabet, and the message will be written using these. Dooley explains how important it is to keep the codebooks or cipher key hidden, as it is the only way to decrypt the message. He ends by explaining how keys word for ciphers and the different ways to decrypt a cipher.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Sources%20and%20Annotations/Dooley/Dooley%20Source%20Note/#links","title":"Links","text":"<ul> <li>Ciphers</li> <li>Ciphers in Modern Times</li> <li>Why are Messages Encoded``</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Sources%20and%20Annotations/Enigma%20Machine/Enigma%20Machine%20Source%20Note/","title":"Enigma Machine Source Note","text":"<p>Title: @smartCryptographyMadeSimple2016 date: 2023-03-07 type: reference</p> <p>tags:: #Encryption #Memex2 </p>"},{"location":"Sources%20and%20Annotations/Enigma%20Machine/Enigma%20Machine%20Source%20Note/#reference","title":"Reference","text":"<p>Smart, NP. 2016.

Gitelman covers the idea that media is a way humans express themselves, as well as how that media affects society. Gitelman breaks down the idea that history is contained in media and that media is constantly evolving, beginning in the past. As Gitelman describes, media is a key to understanding the way the world worked in the past, \"functionally integral to a sense of pastness\" (Gitelman 5). Gitelman illustrates that media is created naturally through society and moves through it as well, which is seen as essential to society. Based on this, looking at key points in media history will give us a better idea of the motives and views of the time. Looking a media through an outsider's lens, Gitelman writes, \"Media are so integral to a sense of what representation itself is\" (Gitelman 4). Media may be described as humans representing something, and whenever something is to be exhibited or represent something in some way, media is the medium used. Media should be looked at as a key to understanding history as well as the way humans express ideas, thoughts and emotions.</p> </li> <li> <p>Gitelman expands on the idea that media has a specific role in society and defines media as socially realized structures of communication. Gitelman sees that media acts as the scientific instrument of society. Gitelman explains that media has a success rate, \"The success of all media depends at some get level on inattention or 'blindness' to the media technologies themselves\" (Gitelman 6). From this Gitelman describes how media requires people to use it without any thought as to why. If one is to understand how a piece of media works inside and out, the excitement gained from using it is lost and that person begins to see its flaws. Gitelman explores how media can govern society and its ideals, \"media become authoritative as the social processes of their definition\" (Gitelman 6). Gitelman describes the idea that people will forget the piece of media they are using to communicate or use for other mediums as it has become so standard in society. The media has taken over society, becoming the foundation of everything that occurs, and it is utilized without considering its intent or value.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"Sources%20and%20Annotations/Gitelman/Gitelman%20Source%20Note/#links","title":"Links","text":"<ul> <li>What is Media</li> <li>Media holds Power</li> <li>Media is evergrowing</li> <li>Mediums</li> <li>Media allows for History</li> <li>Media is Representation</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Sources%20and%20Annotations/Google/%40GoogleStoryOne/","title":"Google: The Story Behind One of the Richest Companies in the World","text":"<p>URL: https://www.thoughtco.com/who-invented-google-1991852</p> <p>Definition</p> <p>A search engine is a program that searches the internet and finds webpages for you based on the keywords that you submit.1</p> <p>Search Engines</p> <p>Search engine software such as boolean operators, search fields, and display format Spider or \"crawler\" software that reads web pages A database Algorithms that rank results for relevance1</p> <p>the name represents the immense amount of information that a search engine has to sift through.1</p> <p>The first type of search algorithm that was able to grab the best results.</p> <p>PageRank that determined a website's relevance by taking into account\u00a0the number of pages, along with the importance of the pages, that linked back to the original site.1</p> <p>Page and Brin met at Stanford University while they were\u00a0graduate students in computer science.1</p> <p>shows the dominance of amazon at the time.</p> <p>Other angel investors included Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos.1</p> <p>A very important thing to note as in the future they would be the ones to break this.</p> <p>company motto \"Do No Evil.\"1</p> <ol> <li> <p>Google: The Story Behind One of the Richest Companies in the World | syndication link \u21a9\u21a9\u21a9\u21a9\u21a9\u21a9\u21a9</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"Sources%20and%20Annotations/Google/Google%20Source%20Note/","title":"Google Source Note","text":"<p>Title: @GoogleStoryOne date: 2023-04-07 type: reference</p> <p>tags:: #Internet #Web </p>"},{"location":"Sources%20and%20Annotations/Google/Google%20Source%20Note/#reference","title":"Reference","text":"<p>Anon. n.d.

In the early stages, cataloguing was a local and individual library practice. Each library constructed its own catalogue, most suited to its purpose. A series of continuous changes through the ages, in both, conventional and non-conventional catalogues, including recent technology inputs added various features to the present day catalogue. Today the computerised catalogue may function like a portal and this function can be exploited infinitely to connect to a variety of data considered useful for library users. The system designers are trying to adopt new trends in OPACs. Web-based catalogues initiated Web 2.0 trends like RSS feeds, blogs, downloadable e-media, and instant messages. The facelift of the simple catalogue was eminent to keep up with the versatile needs of the widely web-exposed library users. - Bibliography: Kumar, S. 2013 From Clay Tablets to Web: Journey of Library Catalogue.

Kumar begins by outlining the main tools a library uses to sort all its acquired knowledge, which is classification as well as the catalogue. A library's catalogue is extremely important in the search for items, and it is the part of a library that is always growing. Libraries began to be organized through tablets, then in the 17th century, the Bodleian catalogue emerged, the first of its kind. As cataloguing grew, libraries began to cooperate and codes/rules were created known as the AACR (Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules) to better improve the process. During the late 20th century, computers began to be implemented in the catalogue-making process and the OPAC (Online Public Access Catalogue). The ability to have access to a catalogue online allowed libraries to connect and create joint catalogues and the user interface was greatly improved allowing for easier ways to search. All the new creations and new ways to search through catalogues show how important it is for the info to be stored and for it to be stored correctly.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Sources%20and%20Annotations/Kumar/Kumar%20Source%20Note/#links","title":"Links","text":"<ul> <li>History of Libraries``</li> <li>The Need to Store Knowledge</li> <li>What is a Library</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Sources%20and%20Annotations/Modems/%40driscollTheBirthOfTheModemWorld/","title":"The Early Part of Internet History That People Don\u2019t Talk About","text":"<p>URL: https://issues.org/prehistory-social-media-modem-world-driscoll/</p> <p>Important to note as, nowadays the term 'internet' cannot be placed on one specific thing.

The article dives into these components as it looks at a fuller history that accounts for the creation of personal computer networks and their convergence with the internet. One of the key components that played a massive role in the history of the internet is the modem. Modems were devices that converted digital signals into audible signals for transmission over a standard telephone line, allowing computers to relay information via telephone. They were quite separate from the internet at the time, as the article describes, and many called it the \"modem world.\" The modem world developed in parallel to the ARPANET family of networks. The modem world was driven by amateur communities, these were distinct spheres of social and technical activity, as the article describes. The article then takes a deep dive into the bulletin board system(BBS). They allowed people interested in exploring the possibilities of an online community to get involved. As we look at the history of the BBS systems, we can see how the current-day internet was formed and can see that it was not just created by the government, but rather input from many people.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Sources%20and%20Annotations/Modems/The%20Modem%20World%20Source%20Note/#links","title":"Links","text":"<ul> <li>How Technology Changes</li> <li>The implications of AI on todays Internet</li> <li>The Internet in Business, Science, School and Government</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Sources%20and%20Annotations/Morse/%40SamuelMorseHis/","title":"Samuel Morse - His life, work and inventions","text":"<p>URL: http://www.samuelmorse.net/</p> <ul> <li>He began as a painter and had the interest of developing a way to communicate electronically and began inventing a telegraph with little to no knowledge of the science behind it.</li> </ul> <p>American painter and inventor who is best remembered today for his invention of single-wire telegraph system and the co-inventor of the Morse code1</p> <p>During his college years, he earned money by painting portraits and studied the subjects of religious philosophy, mathematics and science of horse1</p> <ul> <li>He saw the flaw with communication and that pushed him to try to better it.</li> </ul> <p>Devastated by this news and the inability of the current message system to give him news faster, he started devising a plan to create a new way of fast long distance communication.1</p> <p>After finding out that information sent via copper cables travels instantaneously over great distances, Morse started devising the plan for the creation of single-wire telegraph.1</p> <ul> <li>He ran into the same problem many scientist did.

It was used at railways to conduct traffic, and it allowed for travel time to be reduced significantly. Civilizations in ancient times had other methods of communicating over long distances, such as smoke or large structure, but they were affected by weather. The telegraph needed a language to be used to communicate, as the receiving side had no physical way of hearing the English words the other person was saying. Morse came up with what he called Morse code. It used a series of dots and dashes mapped to each of the letters of the alphabet based off-frequency.

He talks about how society expects a linear story for something such as the web, and he explains how it can be related to the stages of a heroes' story. The stages he explains is the departure, initiation and the return. He also counters this by explains that the true origin of the web is much more complicated and messy.

Ted Nelson and his idea of the hypertext is talked about, and he explains how Berners' mentioned Nelson in his paper.
